    "These recommender systems are next generation recommendations systems, which fall into the hyper-personalization category. It's natural that there won't be an end to the needs of humans. The more we get, the more we want. Though content-based recommender systems are efficient, targeted at an individual level, and consider the user's personal preferences alone while building recommendation engines, people wanted recommendation engines to be more personalized. For example, a person going on a trip alone may need a book to read whereas the same person may need beer if he is travelling with friends. Similarly, the same person might require diapers, medicines, snacks, and so on if he is going with his own family. People at different places at different\n",
    "times with different company have different needs. Our recommender systems should be robust enough to handle such scenarios. Such hyper personalized recommender systems, which cater to different recommendations to the same person based on his current context, are known as context-aware recommender systems."
